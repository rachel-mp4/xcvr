  <h2>known bugs</h2>
  <p>
    <b> inability to validate messages </b> occurs at some points in time,
    possibly after the backend restarts, but i'm not totally sure how or why,
    oauth is a bit mysterious to me still and it's likely a silly error
    somewhere but if you suddenly are unable to make any records while logged
    in, then you should log out and log back in
    <s>
      i actually believe that this should be fixed now! please let me know if
      it's funky
    </s> it was not fixed
  </p>
  <h2>upcoming features</h2>
  <p>
    <b>:emoji: with tab autocomplete</b> is a feature that i really miss from discord
    :/ this should be come sooner
  </p>
  <p>
    <b> whitelist / blacklist </b> is something that is on the horizon!
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>bsky/follow</b> is something i really want to add, i think bsky is inherently
    a very striated space and a pillar of this project is for it to be a smoother
    space that makes it easier to make friends that you can carry to other parts
    of atmosphere
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>building out feed lexicon</b> is farther on the horizon
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>notification lexicon</b> is even further on the horizon
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>facets</b> will probably come a lil bit sooner than full notifications, i
    want you to be able to @people. also, replying to messages may be an option,
    this will get added through lrc
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>impl all of lrc functionality</b> will happen, it's kinda funny that i don't
    have this yet, all of the backend is there i think, maybe i'll work on this sooner
    (this is just like mute, unmute, hug, and i think ban unban, not sure how those
    2 will work they are not impl on backend)
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>images, avis</b> also quite far off, not thinking tooooo hard about these
    yet i don't have a background in web so idrk how any of that works -_-
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>fun homepage system</b> i think this would be outside of lexicon probably,
    but when i imagine this site, i really want to kinda get people interested in
    internet and programming and also i want it to be really participatory and all
    that, so i really want anyone to be able to edit the homepage, and then there's
    like a lil webcomic reader where you can flip through to older homepages. it
    being lexicon removes people's creativity and prevents the manual curation that
    i have in mind...
